1. Hardcoded Credentials/Network Configurations:
  Observed:
  IPs: 192.168.1.108, 192.168.1.1, etc.
  Network-related fields: HOSTIP, SUBMASK, GATEWAYIP, BRIDGENAME.
  Risks:
  Hardcoded IPs and network details might indicate fixed defaults. If attackers know these, they could exploit the system by 
  targeting these default configurations.

2. Insecure Function Usage:
 Functions Identified:
  strcpy, sprintf, system.
 Risks:
  strcpy and sprintf are vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
  system can lead to command injection if input is not sanitized.

3. Log Error Messages:
 Observed:
  Error logs with format strings (ERR (%s|%s|%d): ...).
 Risks:
  Detailed logs might expose sensitive information (e.g., file paths, commands) if accessible to unauthorized users.

4. Access to System-Level Functions:
 Observed:
  Functions like mmap, ioctl, vfork, execvp.
  Paths such as /mnt/mtd/Config/network, /etc/securetty.
 Risks:
  If improperly implemented, these could lead to privilege escalation or system compromise.

5. Potential Information Disclosure:
 Observed:
  Hardcoded paths (/mnt/mtd/Config/network, /proc/net/dev).
  Detailed error messages related to networking (e.g., NetWorkGetMACAddress, NetSetHostIPEx).
 Risks:
  Paths and error logs may help attackers map the system.

6. Default or Fixed Security Measures:
 Observed:
  Fixed MTU: MTU = 1500.
  DHCP configuration in /mnt/mtd/Config/ddns-server.
 Risks:
  These default settings might be exploitable if not updated during deployment.
